- **Example endpoint configuration**:
  ```yaml
  endpoints:
    - path: /ingest/appsflyer
      method: POST
      auth: api_key
      rate_limit: 1000/minute
      
    - path: /ingest/csv
      method: POST  
      auth: iam_role
      max_file_size: 100MB
      
    - path: /ingest/realtime
      method: POST
      auth: oauth
      rate_limit: 10000/minute
  ```
