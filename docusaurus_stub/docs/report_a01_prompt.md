## Prompt Optimization Techniques

<details>
<summary>Strategies for Enhancing GenAI Output Quality</summary>

---

- **Context Injection**: Included A01 requirements (`20-30` users, no manual AWS Console, VPC, EFS, FreeIPA) and `ctx_doc_style` rules in all prompts.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Adjusted prompts `3-4` times for specificity (e.g., added ports `389/636` for FreeIPA).
- **Example-Driven Prompts**: Provided sample HCL/YAML structures to guide Grok/Copilot outputs.
- **Feedback Loops**: Reviewed outputs with `2` DevOps engineers, refined for missing details (e.g., NACLs, SNS alerts).

#### Example Refinement

- **Initial Prompt**: "Design an AWS platform for data engineers."
- **Refined Prompt**:
  ```text
  Using Grok, design a ctx_doc_style-compliant AWS Data Platform for 20-30 users:
  - Include VPC (10.0.0.0/16), EC2 ASG (t3.medium), EFS (multi-AZ), FreeIPA, IAM
  - Provide Terraform modules, Ansible playbooks, and Mermaid diagram
  - Explain business benefits (e.g., 99.9% uptime, cost optimization)
  ```
- **Output Comparison**:
  - **Initial Output**: Generic AWS setup with EC2 and S3.
  - **Refined Output**: Detailed platform with VPC, EFS, FreeIPA, IAM, and timeline Gantt chart.
- **Iterations**: `4` rounds, adding NACLs, backup policies, and AppsFlyer integration.

#### Quality Assurance

- **Validation**: Used `markdownlint` for `ctx_doc_style` compliance (2-space indent, `---` separators).
- **Feedback**: Shared drafts with `3` stakeholders, iterated for clarity (e.g., added business benefits).
- **Efficiency**: Reduced planning from `40` hours to `24` hours (`40%` savings) across `25` prompts.
