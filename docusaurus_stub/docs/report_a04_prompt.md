## Prompt Optimization Techniques

<details>
<summary>Strategies for Enhancing GenAI Output Quality</summary>

---

- **Context Injection**: Included A04 requirements (custom tracking, AppsFlyer, A01/A04b integration) and `ctx_doc_style` rules in all prompts.
- **Iterative Refinement**: Adjusted prompts `3-4` times for specificity (e.g., added GDPR, S2S API details).
- **Example-Driven Prompts**: Provided sample SQL/Python/JavaScript structures to guide Grok/Copilot outputs.
- **Feedback Loops**: Reviewed outputs with `2` engineers and `1` marketing stakeholder, refined for missing details (e.g., fraud protection, S3 integration).

#### Example Refinement

- **Initial Prompt**: "Analyze tracking systems for web and apps."
- **Refined Prompt**:
  ```text
  Using Grok, analyze custom tracking vs AppsFlyer for A04:
  - Include database schema, attribution logic, SDK, S2S API, fraud protection
  - Integrate with A01 VPC, EFS, FreeIPA, IAM, and S3 for AppsFlyer data
  - Provide SQL, Python, JavaScript code, and Mermaid diagrams
  - Explain business benefits (e.g., 20% ROI increase, <1 month deployment)
  Format as ctx_doc_style-compliant Markdown.
  ```
- **Output Comparison**:
  - **Initial Output**: Generic tracking system comparison.
  - **Refined Output**: Detailed analysis with SQL schema, AppsFlyer S2S API, and A01 integration.
- **Iterations**: `4` rounds, adding GDPR compliance, fraud protection, and Gantt chart.

#### Quality Assurance

- **Validation**: Used `markdownlint` for `ctx_doc_style` compliance (2-space indent, `---` separators).
- **Feedback**: Shared drafts with `3` stakeholders, iterated for clarity (e.g., added ROI metrics).
- **Efficiency**: Reduced analysis from `50` hours to `30` hours (`40%` savings) across `40` prompts.
