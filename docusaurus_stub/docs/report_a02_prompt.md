  ```
- **Output Comparison**:
  - **Initial Output**: Generic Dask setup with EC2 and S3.
  - **Refined Output**: Detailed cluster with ALB, FreeIPA, EFS, and AppsFlyer integration.
- **Iterations**: `4` rounds, adding scaling policies, FreeIPA LDAP, and SNS alerts.

#### Quality Assurance

- **Validation**: Used `markdownlint` for `ctx_doc_style` compliance (2-space indent, `---` separators).
- **Feedback**: Shared drafts with `3` stakeholders, iterated for clarity (e.g., added business benefits).
- **Efficiency**: Reduced planning from `50` hours to `27.5` hours (`45%` savings) across `30` prompts.
