## Architecture Design

<details>
<summary>Metaflow Components and AWS Service Integration Patterns</summary>

---

- **Core architecture**: Netflix's Metaflow orchestrating ML workflows with AWS backend services.
- **Service components**:
  - Metaflow service: Central metadata and orchestration engine.
  - Metadata store: PostgreSQL database for pipeline versioning and lineage.
  - Artifact store: S3 buckets for model artifacts and intermediate data.
  - Compute backend: EC2/Batch for scalable pipeline execution.
- **Integration layer**: Connections with A01 platform services (FreeIPA, EFS, VPC).

#### Component Relationships

- **Metaflow service**:
  - Instance type: `m5.large` for metadata API and web UI.
  - Database: RDS PostgreSQL (`db.t3.medium`) for metadata storage.
  - Storage: S3 bucket with versioning for artifact persistence.
- **Compute scaling**:
  - AWS Batch job queues for pipeline step execution.
  - EC2 Spot instances for cost-effective compute resources.
  - Auto-scaling based on pipeline queue depth and resource demands.

---

#### AWS Service Integration

- **S3 artifact storage**:
  ```python
  from metaflow import S3
  
  # Automatic artifact storage
  @step
  def train_model(self):
      # Model artifacts automatically stored in S3
      self.model = train_ml_model(self.data)
      self.next(self.evaluate)
  ```
- **Batch compute integration**: Seamless scaling from local execution to cloud compute.
- **IAM role management**: Integration with A01 FreeIPA for user authentication and S3 access.

      @step
      def start(self):
          self.raw_data = load_training_data()
          self.next(self.preprocess)
      
      @batch(cpu=4, memory=8000)
      @step  
      def preprocess(self):
          self.clean_data = preprocess(self.raw_data)
