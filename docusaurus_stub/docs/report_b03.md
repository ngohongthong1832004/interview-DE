## Fine-tuning Strategies

<details>
<summary>Comparison of Different Approaches</summary>

---

- **Full fine-tuning**: Update all model parameters for maximum flexibility.  
  - **Advantages**: High accuracy for specific tasks.  
  - **Disadvantages**: Requires significant computational resources.  

- **Parameter-efficient fine-tuning**: Update only a subset of parameters (e.g., LoRA, adapters).  
  - **Advantages**: Lower resource requirements, faster training.  
  - **Disadvantages**: May not achieve the same accuracy as full fine-tuning.  

- **Prompt tuning**: Learn task-specific prompts while keeping the model frozen.  
  - **Advantages**: Minimal resource usage, quick to implement.  
  - **Disadvantages**: Limited flexibility for complex tasks.  

- **Quantization-aware fine-tuning**: Optimize model weights for lower precision (e.g., INT8, FP16).  
  - **Advantages**: Reduces memory usage and inference latency.  
  - **Disadvantages**: Requires careful implementation to avoid accuracy loss.  

---

#### Selection Criteria

- **Task complexity**: Choose full fine-tuning for complex tasks, prompt tuning for simpler ones.  
- **Resource availability**: Opt for parameter-efficient methods if resources are limited.  
- **Deployment requirements**: Use quantization-aware fine-tuning for resource-constrained environments.

## Technical Specifications

<details>
<summary>Quantization Methods, Data Requirements, and Optimization Techniques</summary>

---

- **Quantization methods**:
  - **Post-training quantization**: Apply quantization after training.  
  - **Quantization-aware training**: Incorporate quantization during training for better accuracy.  

- **Data requirements**:
  - **Dataset size**: Ensure sufficient data for the target task.  
  - **Data quality**: High-quality, task-specific data improves fine-tuning outcomes.  
  - **Preprocessing**: Clean and tokenize data appropriately.  

- **Optimization techniques**:
  - **Learning rate scheduling**: Use warm-up and decay schedules.  
  - **Gradient clipping**: Prevent exploding gradients during training.  
  - **Regularization**: Apply techniques like dropout to avoid overfitting.

#### Example: Quantization-aware Training

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, TrainingArguments, Trainer

# Load model and tokenizer
model_name = "gpt2"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Enable quantization-aware training
model = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(
    model, {torch.nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8
)

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    save_steps=10_000,
    save_total_limit=2,
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir="./logs",
)

# Define Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()
```

## Implementation Steps

<details>
<summary>Chronological Fine-tuning Procedures</summary>

---

1. **Prepare the environment**:
   - Install required libraries (e.g., `transformers`, `datasets`, `torch`).  
   - Set up GPU/TPU for training.  

2. **Load the pre-trained model**:
   - Use Hugging Face Transformers or similar libraries.  

3. **Prepare the dataset**:
   - Tokenize and preprocess the data.  
   - Split into training, validation, and test sets.  

4. **Define training arguments**:
   - Specify hyperparameters, output directory, and logging settings.  

5. **Train the model**:
   - Use a Trainer or custom training loop.  

6. **Evaluate the model**:
   - Measure performance on validation and test sets.  

7. **Optimize and deploy**:
   - Apply quantization or pruning for deployment.  

---

#### Example: Training Loop

```python
from transformers import AdamW

# Define optimizer
optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(), lr=5e-5)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    model.train()
    for batch in train_dataloader:
        inputs = tokenizer(batch["text"], return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)
        outputs = model(**inputs, labels=inputs["input_ids"])
        loss = outputs.loss
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```

- **Gradient accumulation**: Simulate larger batch sizes on memory-constrained devices.  
- **Mixed precision training**: Use FP16 for faster training and reduced memory usage.  
- **Distributed training**: Scale training across multiple GPUs/TPUs.  
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Experiment with learning rates, batch sizes, and other parameters.  

#### Example: Mixed Precision Training

```python
from torch.cuda.amp import GradScaler, autocast

scaler = GradScaler()

for batch in train_dataloader:
    with autocast():
        outputs = model(**inputs, labels=inputs["input_ids"])
        loss = outputs.loss
    scaler.scale(loss).backward()
    scaler.step(optimizer)
    scaler.update()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
```
