## LiteLLM Tutorial

<details>
<summary>Comprehensive Functionality and Usage Guide</summary>

---

- **Overview**: LiteLLM is a lightweight library for interacting with large language models.  
- **Key features**: Simplified API, multi-model support, and efficient resource usage.  
- **Installation**:
  ```bash
  pip install litellm
  ```

#### Basic Usage

- **Example: Text generation**:
  ```python
  from litellm import LiteLLM

  # Initialize LiteLLM with OpenAI API key
  llm = LiteLLM(api_key="your_openai_api_key")

  # Generate text
  response = llm.generate(
      prompt="Write a short story about AI and humanity.",
      max_tokens=100
  )
  print(response)
  ```

- **Example: Summarization**:
  ```python
  summary = llm.summarize(
      text="""
      Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals.
      """
  )
  print(summary)
  ```
