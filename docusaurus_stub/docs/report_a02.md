# Dask Cluster for Data Processing

---

## Task Overview

<details>
<summary>Objectives and Scope of Dask Distributed Computing Cluster</summary>

## Cluster Architecture Design

<details>
<summary>Detailed Dask Cluster Components and Infrastructure Layout</summary>

---

- **Cluster topology**: Hub-and-spoke architecture with centralized scheduler and distributed workers.
- **Core components**:
  - Dask scheduler: Coordinates work distribution and task management.
  - Dask workers: Execute computation tasks across multiple EC2 instances.
  - Gateway service: Manages user connections and job submissions.
- **Infrastructure layer**:
  - Scheduler node: `c5.xlarge` EC2 instance for task coordination.
  - Worker nodes: Auto-scaling group of `c5.large` instances (`5-20` nodes).
  - Load balancer: Application Load Balancer for user traffic distribution.

#### Node Configuration

- **Scheduler specifications**:
  - Instance type: `c5.xlarge` (`4` vCPUs, `8` GB RAM).
  - Storage: `100` GB GP3 EBS volume for logs and metadata.
  - Network: Private subnet with security group allowing worker communication.
- **Worker specifications**:
  - Instance type: `c5.large` (`2` vCPUs, `4` GB RAM).
  - Storage: `50` GB GP3 EBS + EFS mount for shared data access.
  - Scaling: Auto-scaling based on CPU utilization (`>70%` scale up, `<30%` scale down).

---

#### Network Architecture

- **VPC integration**: Uses existing VPC from A01 with additional subnets for Dask cluster.
- **Security groups**:
  - Scheduler SG: Allows inbound on port `8786` (Dask scheduler).
  - Worker SG: Allows inbound on port `8787` (Dask worker).
  - Gateway SG: Allows inbound on port `8888` (JupyterHub integration).
- **Internal communication**: Direct TCP connections between scheduler and workers.

## User Access Management

<details>
<summary>Authentication Integration and Resource Allocation Strategies</summary>

---

- **Authentication**: Integrate with existing FreeIPA server from A01 for centralized user management.
- **Access control**: Role-based permissions through IAM roles and Dask security configurations.
- **Resource quotas**: Per-user limits to prevent cluster monopolization.
- **Session management**: JupyterHub integration for notebook-based cluster access.

#### FreeIPA Integration

- **User synchronization**: Dask Gateway connects to FreeIPA LDAP for user authentication.
- **Group mapping**: Map FreeIPA groups to Dask cluster access levels:
  - `data_engineers`: Full cluster access with resource quotas.
  - `data_analysts`: Limited access for smaller workloads.
  - `admins`: Cluster administration and monitoring privileges.
- **Configuration example**:
  ```yaml
  authenticator:
    type: ldap
    server: ipa.example.com
    bind_dn: cn=dask-service,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=example,dc=com
  ```

---

#### Resource Management

- **User quotas**: Maximum `4` cores and `8` GB RAM per user session.
- **Queue management**: FIFO scheduling with priority levels based on user groups.
- **Timeout policies**: Automatic session termination after `2` hours of inactivity.
- **Fair sharing**: Prevent single users from consuming `>25%` of cluster resources.

## Terraform and Ansible Integration

<details>
<summary>Infrastructure as Code Implementation for Dask Cluster Deployment</summary>

---

- **Terraform modules**: Extend existing A01 infrastructure with Dask-specific resources.
- **Ansible playbooks**: Configure Dask software stack and integrate with existing platform services.
- **Modular design**: Separate modules for scheduler, workers, and gateway components.
- **Version control**: All IaC configurations stored in Git with CI/CD pipelines.

#### Terraform Configuration

- **Dask scheduler module**:
  ```hcl
  module "dask_scheduler" {
    source = "./modules/dask-scheduler"
    
    instance_type = "c5.xlarge"
    subnet_id     = module.vpc.private_subnets[0]
    security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.dask_scheduler.id]
    
    tags = {
      Name = "dask-scheduler"
      Environment = "production"
    }
  }
  ```
- **Auto-scaling worker group**:
  ```hcl
  resource "aws_autoscaling_group" "dask_workers" {
    name                = "dask-workers"
    min_size            = 5
    max_size            = 20
    desired_capacity    = 10
    vpc_zone_identifier = module.vpc.private_subnets
    
    launch_template {
      id      = aws_launch_template.dask_worker.id
      version = "$Latest"
    }
  }
  ```

---

#### Ansible Playbook Strategy

- **Scheduler configuration**:
  ```yaml
  - name: Install Dask scheduler
    pip:
      name: "dask[complete]"
      state: present
      
  - name: Configure Dask scheduler service
    template:
      src: dask-scheduler.service.j2
      dest: /etc/systemd/system/dask-scheduler.service
    notify: restart dask-scheduler
  ```
- **Worker setup**: Automated installation of Dask worker software with EFS mounting.
- **Gateway deployment**: JupyterHub with Dask Gateway for user access management.

## Performance Optimization

<details>
<summary>Configuration Strategies for Handling Concurrent Users Efficiently</summary>

---

- **Resource allocation**: Dynamic scaling based on workload demands and user activity.
- **Memory management**: Optimized worker memory settings to prevent OOM errors.
- **Network optimization**: Minimize data transfer between scheduler and workers.
- **Storage strategy**: EFS for shared data, local SSDs for temporary computation.

#### Scaling Configuration

- **Horizontal scaling**: Auto-scaling group adjusts worker count based on queue length.
- **Metrics-based scaling**:
  - Scale up: Queue length `>10` tasks or CPU utilization `>70%`.
  - Scale down: Queue length `<2` tasks and CPU utilization `<30%`.
- **Cluster limits**: Maximum `20` worker nodes to control costs.
- **Cool-down periods**: `5` minutes between scaling events to prevent thrashing.

---

#### Memory and CPU Optimization

- **Worker memory**: Configure `3` GB memory per worker (leaving `1` GB for OS).
- **Thread allocation**: `2` threads per worker to match vCPU count.
- **Scheduler tuning**: Increase heartbeat interval to `10` seconds for better performance.
- **Garbage collection**: Automatic cleanup of completed tasks and intermediate results.

## Monitoring and Alerting

<details>
<summary>Comprehensive Cluster Health Tracking and Performance Metrics</summary>

---

- **Monitoring stack**: CloudWatch integration with custom Dask metrics and Grafana dashboards.
- **Key metrics**: Cluster utilization, task completion rates, user session counts, error rates.
- **Alerting rules**: Proactive notifications for cluster issues and performance degradation.
- **Log management**: Centralized logging with ELK stack for troubleshooting.

#### CloudWatch Integration

- **Custom metrics**:
  ```python
  import boto3
  cloudwatch = boto3.client('cloudwatch')
  
  # Report cluster utilization
  cloudwatch.put_metric_data(
      Namespace='Dask/Cluster',
      MetricData=[
          {
              'MetricName': 'ActiveWorkers',
              'Value': active_worker_count,
              'Unit': 'Count'
          }
      ]
  )
  ```
- **Dashboard components**: Real-time worker status, task queue length, user activity.
- **Historical analysis**: Performance trends and usage patterns over time.

---

#### Alert Configuration

- **Critical alerts**: Scheduler failure, worker node unavailability, memory exhaustion.
- **Warning alerts**: High CPU utilization (`>85%`), long task queues (`>50` tasks).
- **Notification channels**: SNS topics for email alerts to administrators.
- **Escalation policies**: Automatic ticket creation for persistent issues.
